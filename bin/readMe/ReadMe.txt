/*This 2D platformer game was created by team members Nick,
* Sebastion, and Angelica. It includes a fully functional GUI
* screen for the user and when a play state is entered, it allows
* for the user to play as a knight and defeat ghost enemies by jumping
* on top of them! As this is only v1.0, there is currently only one level
* with minimal assets included but full functionality is available for
* demonstration. Enjoy!
